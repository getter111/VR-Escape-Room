# 🧙‍♂️ VR Wizard Hut Escape Room 

Immersive virtual reality escape room experience built in Unity using the XR Interaction Toolkit. Players are trapped inside a wizard's hut and must brew potions, collect wands, and solve puzzles to escape.

## 🔮 Features

- **Fully Interactive VR Environment**  
  Interact with books, axes, chess pieces, and other environmental props in the magical wizard hut.

- **Potion Brewing System**  
  Collect ingredients and brew potions with special effects (e.g. shrink potion) that change your perception and unlock different POVs.

- **Magic Wands**  
  - **Fireball Wand**: Launches fireballs to interact with objects.  
  - **Telekinesis Wand**: Remotely manipulates objects using ray-based interaction.
  - **Lighting Wand**: Shoots lighting beams to interact with objects.  

- **Magic Mushroom Helper**  
  A riddle-speaking mushroom that provides hints when objects are presented to it — designed to assist players with contextual guidance.

## 🎮 Gameplay Demo Observations

- **Player Reactions**:  
  Most playtesters were excited by the interactive elements and unique potion effects.

- **Common Challenges**:  
  Players often ignored the magic mushroom helper and experimented freely with random items. Many expressed confusion without external guidance.

## 📚 Lessons Learned

- **User Guidance Is Crucial**  
  Players struggled without clear, intuitive direction. Future versions will include contextual voice hints and improved onboarding.

- **Immersion Through Interaction**  
  Presence was enhanced by allowing players to naturally interact with the world (e.g. shrinking, throwing objects, using magic).
